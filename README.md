## Rootbeer

The Rootbeer GPU Compiler makes it easy to use Graphics Processing Units from
within Java.

Rootbeer is more advanced than CUDA or OpenCL Java Language Bindings. With 
bindings the developer must serialize complex graphs of objects into arrays
of primitive types. With Rootbeer this is done automatically. Also with language
bindings, the developer must write the GPU kernel in CUDA or OpenCL. With
Rootbeer a static analysis of the Java Bytecode is done (using Soot) and CUDA
code is automatically generated.

## Development notes

Rootbeer was created using Test Driven Development and testing is essentially
important in Rootbeer. Rootbeer is 20k lines of product code and 8.8k of test code
and 48/58 tests currently pass on Windows, Linux and Mac. The Rootbeer test case suite 
covers every aspect of the Java Programming language except:
  1. native methods
  2. reflection
  3. dynamic method invocation
  4. sleeping while inside a monitor. 
  
The original publication for Rootbeer was in HPCC-2012.

This work is supported by the National Science Foundation grant number 
MCB-0746066 to R.D.W. and God is Most High.

Work is on-going to improve performance with Rootbeer. Currently Rootbeer has
competative speed when using single-dimensional arrays of primitive types.

## Building

1. Clone the github repo to `rootbeer1/`
2. `cd rootbeer1/`
3. `ant jar`
4. `./pack-rootbeer` (linux) or `./pack-rootbeer.bat` (windows)
5. Use the `rootbeer1/Rootbeer.jar` (not `dist/Rootbeer1.jar`)
